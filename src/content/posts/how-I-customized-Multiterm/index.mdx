import TestDiagram from "./comm-diagram-test.svg"
import TestDiagram2 from "./comm-diagram-test-2.svg"

For my personal site, I want the additional capability to add commutative diagrams and other $\LaTeX$ features that match the theme selected theme of the site.
## LaTeX Diagrams

This solution requires you to change the file extensions for posts from `.md` to `.mdx` and import all of your diagrams at the top of the file:

```md wrap
---
title: 'Blog Post Title'
.
.
.
---
import TestDiagram from "./comm-diagram-test.svg"
import TestDiagram2 from "./comm-diagram-test-2.svg"
.
.
.
```

Render them in $\LaTeX$ using [quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) or some other tool. Use [upmath](https://upmath.me/) by rendering as html, viewing the source by following the link, and saving the page with `ctrl + s` as an `svg`.

In the `global.css` file, add the following at the bottom of the file:

```css
.diagram {
  width: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  /* top bottm left right */
  margin: 3rem auto;
  fill: currentColor;
}

.diagram path,
.diagram line,
.diagram polyline,
.diagram polygon {
  /* to avoid having bloated glyphs on mobile */
  vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke;
  stroke: currentColor;
}
```

Finally, inline the diagrams

```md title="Inlined Diagrams" wrap
<TestDiagram class="diagram" />
<TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
```

<TestDiagram class="diagram" />

(some text between them)

<TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />

To place two diagrams next to each other, add the following styling to the end of  `global.css` file:

```css
.diagram-row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

Place your diagrams next to each other like so:

```md title="Inlined Diagrams Next to Each Other" wrap
<div class="diagram-row">
  <TestDiagram class="diagram" />
  <TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
</div>
```

<div class="diagram-row">
  <TestDiagram class="diagram" />
  <TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
</div>


## Miscellaneous Modifications

In addition to the above modifications for having responsive $\LaTeX$ diagrams, I will keep a record of the other small customizations that I have made to Multiterm.

### Increasing the Article Width

In the `Layouts.astro` file, there is a section specifying the layout of the page, along with some `tailwindcss` styling:
```astro
<body class="w-full h-full m-0 bg-background text-foreground">
    <div
      class="flex flex-col max-w-3xl min-h-screen border-accent/10 m-auto p-3 sm:py-5 sm:px-6 md:py-10"
    >
      <Header />
      <main class="flex flex-col py-1">
        <slot />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
</body>
```
To increase the article width, we can change maximum width parameter (I changed it to something between `3xl` and `4xl`)
```astro
    <div
      class="flex flex-col max-w-[52rem] min-h-screen border-accent/10 m-auto p-3 sm:py-5 sm:px-6 md:py-10"
    >
```

### Fixing Giscus

I am currently having some issues setting up Giscus for comments on my blogpost. I have tried various attempts to fix the issue that I am experiencing, but with no luck. The issue is linked here: [https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/1684](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/1684)
