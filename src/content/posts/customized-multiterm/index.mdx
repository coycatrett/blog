import TestDiagram from "./comm-diagram-test.svg"
import TestDiagram2 from "./comm-diagram-test-2.svg"

The main feature that I wanted for this blog was to have a way to embed commutative diagrams that match the theme selected theme of the site. This post will discuss my current process for achieving this, along with some other miscellaneous modifications.


## LaTeX Diagrams

This solution requires you to change the file extensions for posts from `.md` to `.mdx` and import all of your diagrams at the top of the file:

```md title="index.mdx"
---
title: 'Blog Post Title'
.
.
.
---
import TestDiagram from "./comm-diagram-test.svg"
import TestDiagram2 from "./comm-diagram-test-2.svg"
.
.
.
```

Render them in $\LaTeX$ using [quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) or some other tool. Use [upmath](https://upmath.me/) by rendering as html, viewing the source by following the link, and saving the page with `ctrl + s` as an `svg`.

In the `global.css` file, add the following at the bottom of the file:

```css title="global.css"
.diagram {
  width: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  /* [top bottom] [left right] */
  margin: 3rem auto;
  fill: currentColor;
}

.diagram path,
.diagram line,
.diagram polyline,
.diagram polygon {
  /* to avoid having bloated glyphs on mobile */
  vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke;
  stroke: currentColor;
  stroke-width: 0.075rem;
}
```

Finally, inline the diagrams

```md title="Inlined Diagrams" wrap
<TestDiagram class="diagram" />
<TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
```

<TestDiagram class="diagram" />

(some text between them)

<TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />

To place two diagrams next to each other, add the following styling to the end of  `global.css` file:

```css title="global.css"
.diagram-row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

Place your diagrams next to each other like so:

```md title="Inlined Diagrams Next to Each Other" wrap
<div class="diagram-row">
  <TestDiagram class="diagram" />
  <TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
</div>
```

<div class="diagram-row">
  <TestDiagram class="diagram" />
  <TestDiagram2 class="diagram" />
</div>

The diagrams will now change their color with the selected theme :slightly_smiling_face:

:::note
I believe the maintainers of [quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) are working on exporting diagrams to `svg`; until then, this will be my current work-around.

## Miscellaneous Modifications

In addition to the above modifications for having responsive $\LaTeX$ diagrams, I will keep a record of the other small customizations that I have made to Multiterm.

### Increasing the Article Width

In the `Layouts.astro` file, there is a section specifying the layout of the page, along with some `tailwindcss` styling:
```astro title="Layouts.astro" wrap
<body class="w-full h-full m-0 bg-background text-foreground">
    <div
      class="flex flex-col max-w-3xl min-h-screen border-accent/10 m-auto p-3 sm:py-5 sm:px-6 md:py-10"
    >
      <Header />
      <main class="flex flex-col py-1">
        <slot />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
</body>
```

To increase the article width, we can change maximum width parameter (I changed it to something between `3xl` and `4xl`)

```astro title="Layouts.astro" wrap
    <div
      class="flex flex-col max-w-[52rem] min-h-screen border-accent/10 m-auto p-3 sm:py-5 sm:px-6 md:py-10"
    >
```

### Setting Up Giscus 

Setting up Giscus was relatively straightforward by following the directions found on the [giscus.app](http://giscus.app). The one thing that was confusing for me was setting up the `giscus.json` and using the `origins` key correctly. The below can be found at [Advanced Usage Giscus Documentation](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/ADVANCED-USAGE.md).

The `origins` field is used to control the domains can read from and write to the GitHub discussions on your blog's repository. The `origins` key accepts a list of strings that are checked against the `window.origin` of the page that loads Giscus. Another key that the `giscus.json` accepts is the `originsRegex` key, which accepts a regular expression representing a set of domain names to be tested against the `window.origin` of the page that loads Giscus. 

An example `giscus.json` looks like this:

```json title="giscus.json"
{
  "origins": [
    "https://your-blogs-domain-name"
  ],
  "originsRegex": [
    "http://localhost:[0-9]+"
  ]
}
```

After pushing to your remote repository with this `giscus.json`, your blog's domain and any ports exposed by your machine's local host have read and write permissions to the GitHub discussions on your blog's repository.

In my case, when I set up my `giscus.json`, I had set my `origins` key incorrectly. Giscus wasn't loading comments and was being redirected to [https://github.com/orgs/giscus/discussions/1298](https://github.com/orgs/giscus/discussions/1298) (you can find this redirect in the Network Monitor section of your browser's developer tools), but figuring out that my `origins` key was incorrect was tricky. If you end up being redirected here when setting up Giscus, make sure that your domain names are correct in your `giscus.json`.

I have documented my process troubleshooting my specific issue: [https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/1684](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/1684).


### Staying Synced with stelcodes

Since I forked this template from [stelcodes/multiterm-astro](https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro), I wanted my fork to stay up to date with the original repository. To do so, I followed [this guide](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/153608).
